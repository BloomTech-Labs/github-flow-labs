# Labs Github Flow

- The following is a guided project that will help you understand the git work flow that we use in Lambda Labs.

## Description

- Throughout your Lambda School experience thus far you have learned how to work with Git/GitHub and have had practice using the basic commands for staging, commiting, pushing and publishing your commits to a fork. Learning now, the rest of what you need in order to work as a productive member of a product organization will set you up for success not only in labs, but give you insight into what how the product teams work in the real world.

## Purpose

- Knowing a team work flow using Git/GitHub is absolutely vital for you to succeed as a tech professional. That is the purpose of this exercise.

## Objectives

- By the end of this guided project you will have demonstrated the following:
  - You will be able to create a _branch_ off of the **master** branch of a repository.
  - You will be able to submit a _pull-request_ from your feature branch onto the **master** branch.
  - You will be able to _merge_ the **master** branch onto your feature branch.
  - You will be able to resolve any _merge conflicts_ that come up.
  - You will be able to delete a feature branch.

- **Step 2️⃣:** CD into the repository and create a branch off of the master branch. 
  - Name the branch **"feature/add-name"** `git checkout -b 'feature/add-name`
  - **note**: this is the naming convention you will use in Lambda Labs. 
  - Once the branch is created run `git branch` to ensure that you've switched to the new branch. (You should be in the habit of doing this by the end of your first week in labs).
- **Step 3️⃣:**
